###Changelog for WP-Forge###

###v5.2.3.1a
* Seems in my haste to push out a fix for the Off Canvas issue, I forgot to change the version number in all of the files of WP-Forge. My apologies.

###v5.2.3.1###
* Added data-offcanvas attribute to line 13 of content-off_canvas.php - Seems Foundation added this to Off Canvas in 5.2.3

####v5.2.3####
* Updated to latest version of Foundation 5.2.3
* Added 'none' to the options for Background Position in the theme customizer.
* Changed the default text of the menu fallback function
* Updated normalize.css to 3.0.1 http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/
* Added 'contain' to the Background Size option in customizer.
* Added Font-Awesome back into the mix. The shortcode plugin I am working on will use this font as well.
* Combined all font css into one file.
* Social menu icons are now handled by Font-Awesome. Font-Awesome provides a larger array of social icons.
* Added Russion Translation - Thanks to Andriy https://github.com/helirexi
