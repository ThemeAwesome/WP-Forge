Welcome to WP-Forge v5.2.2.2
====================

###Updated 4-26-2014###

WP-Forge is based off [Twenty Twelve] (http://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwelve) and is a combination of two powerful platforms. The first being WordPress, the leading open source blogging tool and content management system. The second being Foundation, the most advanced responsive front-end framework.

###Built with the following tools###
* [WordPress Theme Standards] (http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development) - A list of standards that all themes should be coded with set forth by WordPress.
* [WP-Test](http://wptest.io/) - An exhaustive set of test data that was developed over three years to measure the integioty of themes and plugins. Developed by [Michael Novotny](http://manovotny.com/)
* [Theme Unit Test] (http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test) - Similar to WP-Test. A set of test data created by the WordPress Theme Review Team
* [Debug Bar](http://wordpress.org/plugins/debug-bar/) - a debugging menu added to the admin bar that quickly shows query, cache, and other helpful debugging information.
* [Log Depreceated Notices](http://wordpress.org/plugins/log-deprecated-notices/) - a plugin that helps you identify old WordPress API functions a theme or plugin is currently using so you can update to the newer methods.
* [Theme Check](http://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/) - a simple and easy way to test your theme for all the latest WordPress standards and practices.
* [Theme Mentor](http://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-mentor/) - the cousin of Theme-Check plugin. It does deeper code analysis to ensure best practices, like checking for the dequeueing of jQuery.
* [Monster Widget] (http://wordpress.org/plugins/monster-widget/) - A widget that provides a quick and easy method of adding all core widgets to a sidebar for testing purposes.
* [Viewport Resizer](http://lab.maltewassermann.com/viewport-resizer/) - a handy bookmarklet that will load your site in a viewport the size of common devices. This is helpful in testing responsive design.

###Theme Customizer###
When 3.4 was released, WordPress introduced the [Theme Customizer] (https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Customization_API). The customizer allows you modify certain areas of a theme and preview those changes in real time. WP-Forge now comes with its own custom Theme Customizer. For more information regarding the Theme Customizer please read the information under Configuration in the readme.txt file.

###Off-Canvas Support###
WP-Forge now offers support for Off-Canvas menu. For more information regarding Off-Canvas please read the information under Configuration in the readme.txt file.

###jQuery###
WP-Forge uses the version of jQuery bundled with WordPress and it is loaded in the header. This practice falls within the [WordPress Theme Standards] (http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development). You can do a search and find the information you need to use Google's version and load it in the footer if you wish.

###Child Theme###
I have created a child theme for WP-Forge called [WP-Starter] (https://github.com/tsquez/wp-starter). If you prefer, you can create your own child theme. You can learn how to create your own child theme by reading the [WordPress Codex] (http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)

###Font Awesome 4.0.3###
Includes what I consider the best free icon font in the world Font Awesome: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/

###Yoast SEO Plugin###
Has built in support for breadcrumbs using the Wordpress SEO by Yoast plugin. The code is already added to all necessary files for you. Download the [WordPress SEO by Yoast] (http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) plugin.

###Github Updater###
Added support for Andy Fragen's [Github Updater] (https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) - Now you will can update WP-Forge from within WordPress itself. Make sure you download and install the plugin.

###WP-Forge Demo###
You can see a demo of WP-Forge here: http://wpforge.themeawesome.com/ - The Viewport Resizer is available on the home page of the demo site. Simply click the button that states "Test WP-Forge Responsiveness" and the Viewport Resizer bar will appear at the top of the site allowing to test the theme against various device sizes.

###WP-Forge Forums###
If you need help with implementation or if you run into issues, you can post your questions/issues here or visit the forums: http://themeawesome.com/forums
