Welcome to WP-Forge v5.5.2.1
====================

###Updated 05-06-2015

WP-Forge is a combination of two powerful platforms. The first being WordPress, the leading open source blogging tool and content management system. The second being Zurb's Foundation for Sites, the most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world.

###WP-Forge was built with the following tools###
* [WordPress Theme Standards] (http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development) - A list of standards that all themes should be coded with set forth by WordPress.
* [WP-Test](http://wptest.io/) - An exhaustive set of test data that was developed over three years to measure the integioty of themes and plugins. Developed by [Michael Novotny](http://manovotny.com/)
* [Theme Unit Test] (http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test) - Similar to WP-Test. A set of test data created by the WordPress Theme Review Team
* [Debug Bar](http://wordpress.org/plugins/debug-bar/) - a debugging menu added to the admin bar that quickly shows query, cache, and other helpful debugging information.
* [Log Depreceated Notices](http://wordpress.org/plugins/log-deprecated-notices/) - a plugin that helps you identify old WordPress API functions a theme or plugin is currently using so you can update to the newer methods.
* [Theme Check](http://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/) - a simple and easy way to test your theme for all the latest WordPress standards and practices.
* [Theme Mentor](http://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-mentor/) - the cousin of Theme-Check plugin. It does deeper code analysis to ensure best practices, like checking for the dequeueing of jQuery.
* [Monster Widget] (http://wordpress.org/plugins/monster-widget/) - A widget that provides a quick and easy method of adding all core widgets to a sidebar for testing purposes.
* [Viewport Resizer](http://lab.maltewassermann.com/viewport-resizer/) - a handy bookmarklet that will load your site in a viewport the size of common devices. This is helpful in testing responsive design.
* [Screenfly](http://quirktools.com/screenfly/) – Responsive screen testing for monitors, tablets, smart phones, and more (personally one of my favorites).

##Features##

###Theme Customizer###
When 3.4 was released, WordPress introduced the [Theme Customizer] (https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Customization_API). The customizer allows you to modify certain areas of a theme and preview those changes in real time before publishing. WP-Forge now comes with its own custom Theme Customizer. For more information regarding the Theme Customizer please read the information under Configuration in the README.txt file.

###Off-Canvas Support###
WP-Forge now offers support for `Off-Canvas menu`. For more information regarding Off-Canvas please read the information under Configuration in the readme.txt file.

###jQuery###
WP-Forge uses the version of jQuery bundled with WordPress and it is loaded in the header. This practice falls within the [WordPress Theme Standards] (http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development). You can do a search and find the information you need to use Google's version and load it in the footer if you wish.

###Child Theme###
I have created a child theme for WP-Forge called [WP-Starter] (https://github.com/tsquez/wp-starter). If you prefer, you can create your own child theme. You can learn how to create your own child theme by reading the [WordPress Codex] (http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)

###Genericons 3.3###
Includes the free WordPress icon set [Genericons] (http://genericons.com/#wordpress)

###Yoast SEO Plugin###
Has built in support for breadcrumbs using the Wordpress SEO by Yoast plugin. The code is already added to all necessary files for you. Download the [WordPress SEO by Yoast] (http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) plugin.
