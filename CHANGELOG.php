<!-- Changelog v5.2.2.4 -->
1.) Removed all styles back to their own style sheets and called them appropriately through functions.php - Apparently this was causing WP-Forge to display incorrectly in IE and FF.

<!-- Changelog v5.2.2.3 -->
1.) Moved all css files to style.css
2.) Removed Fontawesome icon set and added the Genericons font http://genericons.com/#wordpress
3.) Changed the way the information for posts is displayed. Moved categories a post is assigned to above the title. Moved the post date, author and comments directly under the title. Tags are still listed after the post as well as the edit button that appears when the admin is logged in.
4.) Adjusted the social menu css to reflect the Genericons font.
5.) Moved the fonts folder into the inc folder
6.) Github versions of WP-Forge are now be tagged. This will allow end users to revert to previous releases of WP-Forge.
7.) Changed the appearance of the author information area - This will provide a more consitent look across different platforms. I didn't like the way it was appearing on smaller screens.
8.) Fixed issue with the post title being displayed as a link in single post view.

<!-- Changelog v5.2.2.2 -->
1.) Added support for the Github Updater from Andy Fragen https://github.com/afragen/github-updater - You will now be able to update WP-Forge from within WordPress itself. You need to download and install the Github Updater.

<!-- Changelog v5.2.2.1 -->
1.) Changed the max-width of rows in foundation.css from 62.5rem to 100%. Changed the max-width of #wrapper in style.css to 64rem (this is equivilant to 1024px based on 16px font size). This change will make it easier for users to change the width of the theme to whatever they like, even to full width.
2.) Removed the background color from rows. This is not needed as the background color of the wrapper element is white.
3.) Added function that links all post thumbnails to the post permalink.
4.) Added html5 shim to header (seems prevalent in WordPress themes)
5.) Added function that wraps inserted images in posts/pages with figure and figcaption. (thanks Tommie Landstrom)
6.) Corrected word-wrap and overflow-x issue with <pre> element. 
7.) Added data-options="mobile_show_parent_link: true" to top-bar. This will now display the parent link in mobile view. See http://foundation.zurb.com/forum/posts/809-top-bar-parent-links for more details (again thanks Tommie Landstrom)
8.) Moved Modernizr to load after jQuery

<!-- Changelog as of 03/31/2014 -->
1.) Removed content-loop.php - This file was causing post formats to display incorrectly when "Show Full Post or Excerpt?" in the theme customizer was set to excerpt. I coded it
in an inefficient manner when I should have used the proper conditionals. Every thing is working properly.
