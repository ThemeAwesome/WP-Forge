= 6.3.0.1 =

Theme updated 02/27/17

* Corrected an issue in the 'theme-dashboard.php' file. Seems I added the version code in the wrong area.

= 6.3.0 =

Theme updated 02/27/17

* Updated to Foundation version 6.3.0.1
* Updated Font-Awesome to 4.7
* Removed ap.js - moved the actual call for foundation to theme-functions.js - now there is only one file.
* Added 'what-input.js' and 'foundation.js' to the 'wpforge_theme_functions' of functions.php - this makes the scripts load closer to the closing body tag as they were meant to be.
* Moved to one off-canvas file for the theme. There is no need to have two of the same files being called by two different fuinctions, when one file and one function will do.
* Moved Use Off-Canvas for Mobile? to Top-Bar Settings section.
* Added options for off-canvas that will appear when Use Off-Canvas for Mobile? is set to 'Yes' in Top-Bar Settings. These settings only affect mobile Off-Canvas (the off-canvas menu used in conjunction with the top-bar)
* Switched 'data-accordion' to 'data-drilldown' in off-canvas. 'data-accordion' still does not work as of 6.3.0.1 and is slated to be possibly added to next major release, 6.4. See this thread https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/pull/9348 - For now 'data-drilldown' will remain in place until the 'data-accordion' is corrected and functions properly. Thanks to @cbirdsong for asking how this is done, which promted the switch: See https://wordpress.org/support/topic/parent-links-of-off-canvas-mobile-menu-not-working/
* Updated 'off-canvas' menu to the latest version. Unfortunately, only two Off-Canvas Directions are available: 'position-left' and 'position-right'. The other positions, 'position-top' and 'position-bottom', are slated for possible inclusion in the next update, keep in mind I make no guarantee that they will. The reason they were not added in this update is due to the fact that currently the menu does not look proper if top or bottom is used.
* Added the abilty for the user to set the Off-Canvas Transitions to 'push' or 'overlap'.
* Removed Foundation 'active' class from menus. Switched to'current-menu-item', which is already built into WP core. In my opinion this is a much better option and is easier to style. Thanks @OttoPotto for bringing up this request which gave me the idea to switch. See this thread https://github.com/tsquez/wp-forge/issues/50
* Removed the title-bar title link from top-bar and off-canvas menus. In my opinion, I feel this is redundant as normally users add a link to the home page in the menu.
* Switched to 'data-sticky-container' and 'data-sticky' in place of 'fixed' for the main menu when the Top-Bar is set to Top of Browser - Fixed.
* Moved 'Use Off-Canvas for Mobile?' section into the Top-Bar Settings section after movng towards one off-canvas file. Makes more sense this option should only be available if the top-bar is selected as the primary menu.
* Modified the js code in contain-to-grid.js, which was eventually moved it to theme-functions.js. See this thread https://github.com/tsquez/wp-forge/issues/51 Thanks to @HenkBarreveld.
* By modifying and moving the 'contain-to-grid' js this allowed for the removal of the 'wpforge_contain_to_grid' function from functions.php as well as removal of the actual 'contain-to-grid.js' file, as it was no longer needed.
* Corrected a few issues with all of the different navigation menus regarding colors. Specific issues were how the 'current-menu-item' appeared for the top-bar and off-canvas menus. Typically what would happen is, if the colors for the active or 'current-menu-item' were selected for the top-bar, those color choices were applied to 'off-canvas' as well. What if the user wanted different colors for the 'current-menu-item' in 'off-canvas'? So I added 'current-menu-item' color choices to Off-Canvas Colors section.
* Wrapped Recent Posts, Popular Categories, Monthly Archives and Popular Tags elements of 404.php in <ul>.
* Removed references to earlier versions of the theme from CHANGELOG.txt. These references referred to an earlier version of WP-Forge which was built using Foundation 5.
* Removed the old admin notice. Replaced with a new theme info page located under Apperance called 'WP-Forge Theme'.

* Wrapped 'wpforge_setup' function in a 'if_function_exists'. This function is located in functions.php.

* Updated Foundation to latest version, 6.3.0.1
* Corrected issue with 'active' class css in menu widget. The background was filled the active color.

* Modified contain-to-grid.js - Thanks to @HenkBarreveld for the suggestion - see this thread: https://github.com/tsquez/wp-forge/issues/49

* Added flex-video class to videos shared from VideoPress.com.
* Corrected issue with the arrow not showing in select boxes.
* Added a "scroll to" function to 'theme-functions.js' this will allow you to add anchor points to content in your theme and associate links with those anchors. When the link is clicked, the theme will scroll to the anchor point.

= 6.2 =

Theme updated 03/27/16

* Updated to the latest version of Zurb's Foundation, 6.2

* With the increase in width, I decided to add a fourth footer widget.
