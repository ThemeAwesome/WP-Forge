Welcome to WP-Forge
====================
WP-Forge is based off of the Twenty Twelve theme and is a combination of two powerful platforms. The first being WordPress, the leading open source blogging tool and content management system. The second being Foundation (v4.3.1), the most advanced responsive front-end framework.

###jQuery###
I designed WP-Forge to use Google's version of jQuery, currently 1.10.2, and it is loaded in the footer. jQuery is loaded in noconflict mode but this may still cause problems with some plugins. So if you encounter any issues, you can easily load jQuery in the header.

###Child Theme###
You can of course use WP-Forge right out of the box for your projects, but I recommend that you create a Child Theme when using WP-Forge for client work. The reason behind this is that Foundation will soon be pushing out Foundation 5 and WP-Forge will be updated accordingly. Using a child theme will allow you to update the parent theme without losing any edits in your child theme. You can check out the WordPress codex on how to do this: http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes

###WP-Forge Demo###

###Font Awesome###
Includes the best icon font in the world Font Awesome: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/

###PressTrends###
A quick note to users, WP-Forge uses the [PressTrends](http://www.presstrends.io/) a service that provides analytics for WordPress users and developers. This helps track the usage of the theme in order to assist with theme improvements. You can of course disable this by modifyng the functions.php file (you will see the appropriate area to comment out).
